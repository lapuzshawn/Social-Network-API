# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Task
This application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. 
You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.

You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the 
[Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, 
you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice 
or the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.
